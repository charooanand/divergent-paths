        The second half of the 20th century began with progressivist hopes for racial equality – or at least a march towards it.
        In particular, the 1950s and '60s ushered in landmark gains for African Americans in the form of desegregation, Civil Rights and Voting Rights.

  <p id="prompt">Let's explore two different ways to visualize differences in Black and White men's earnings.</p>

  <p>
    If we're thinking about how much more White men earned compared to their Black counterparts, a natural measure is to compare the median income of a White man to that of a Black man. 
    This is a simple and informative statistic. However, the median tells us about the experience of very specific people – two men who are right in the middle of their group's income distribution.
    What about two men who are top earners? Or two men at the 15th percentile? Those comparisons are also informative.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the graph below you can see the income distributions for White and Black men across decades. By hovering over the bars you can observe the income level for each group at the same percentile, and the associated earnings gap.

  </div>

  <div class="earnings-rank-intro">
    <h3 id="section-headings">The Earnings Rank Gap</h3>
  </div>

  <p>
    Another way to measure differences is to ask: where would a Black man's earnings place him within the White income distribution? 
    For example, if the median Black man earned $30k, that puts him at the 50th percentile among Black men, but maybe only the 20th percentile among White men — a 30-point gap.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the graph below, when you hover over the bars, you can see the percentile within each group's distribution that corresponds to an income level.
