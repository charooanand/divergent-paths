      The second half of the 20th century began with progressivist hopes for racial equality - or at least a march towards it. 
      In particular, the 1950s and '60s ushered in landmark gains for African Americans in the form of desegregation, Civil Rights and Voting Rights.

<p id = "prompt"> Let's explore two different ways to visualize differences in Black and White men's earnings. </p>


<div class="earnings-level-intro">
<h3 id = "section-headings"> The Earnings Level Gap </h3>
</div>

<div>

<p>If we're thinking about much more White men earned compared to their Black counterparts, a natural measure, and the approach that most studies follow, is to compare the median income of a White man to that of a Black man. This is a simple and informative statistic. However, there isn't anything especially meaningful or magical about the median. 
The median income of a racial group is, to be formal, the income level such that 50% of that group earn less than that level. Medians, therefore, tell us about the experience of very specific people – two men who are bang in the middle of their respective racial group's income distribution. What about two men who are the top earners in their respective racial groups? That's also informative. What about two men who are at the 15th percentile in their respective racial groups? That's also informative.</p>


<p>In the graph below you can see the income distributions for White and Black men across decades. By hovering over the bars you can observe the income level for each group at the same percentile, and the associated earnings gap. One advantage of this approach is that we can more clearly see how unemployment or non-participation in the labor force (perhaps due to incarceration) differentially shapes White and Black income distributions, and therefore the measures of the earnings level gap.</p>

<div class="earnings-rank-intro">
<h3 id = "section-headings"> The Earnings Rank Gap </h3>
</div>

<div>
  <p> An alternative way to measure differences in Black and White men's earnings is to think about where a Black man's earnings would place him within the White income distribution. For example, say the median Black man earned $30k. This income might place him at the 50th percentile among Black men but it might only place him at the 20th percentile among White men. In this example, at the $30k level, there is an earning rank difference of 50 - 20 = 30.</p>
  <p> In the graph below you can see the same income distributions as before. However, now, when you hover over the bars, you can see the percentile within each group's income distribution that is associated with any income level. </p>
